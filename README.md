Car Rental System Backend
This repository contains the backend code for a Car Rental System application by developer johnson mwangi. The application is built using the following technologies:

Hono: A lightweight microservices framework for building scalable and resilient applications.
Drizzle: A data management library for managing state in modern web applications.
TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Node.js and npm: Installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the Node.js website.
Hono and Drizzle: Installed globally. You can install them via npm by running:
npm install -g hono drizzle

Java Development Kit (JDK): Installed on your machine. You can download and install it from Oracleâ€™s website.
Apache Maven: Installed on your machine. You can download and install it from Mavenâ€™s website.
Running the Backend (Hono and Drizzle)
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the backend directory:
cd backend

Build the project using Maven:
mvn clean install

Run the Java application:
java -jar target/car-rental-backend.jar
This will start the backend server on http://localhost:8080.
Additional Notes
The backend application is configured to run on port 8080 by default. If you need to change this port, modify the application.properties file located in the backend/src/main/resources directory.
The frontend application (if available) should be configured to proxy requests to http://localhost:8080, assuming the backend is running on the default port.
Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your specific requirements! If you have any further questions, donâ€™t hesitate to ask. ðŸš—ðŸ”§
